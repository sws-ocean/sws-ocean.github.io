Great set—here’s a crisp, technical summary of each paper (chronological), with key numbers and why they matter.

Stevens et al., 2020 — Nature Climate Change
A recent decline in North Atlantic Subtropical Mode Water formation

Question. How has North Atlantic STMW changed since ~2010?

Approach. Observations and reanalyses to quantify STMW formation and its drivers.

Key results. STMW formation volume fell by ~86–93% from 2010 to 2018 during prolonged surface warming and anticyclonic anomalies. Implication: reduced storage/ventilation capacity for heat and climatically relevant tracers. 

Why it matters. A weaker STMW reservoir alters upper-ocean heat uptake and mid-latitude oxygen/carbon budgets.

Stevens, Pawlowicz & Allen, 2021 — Journal of Physical Oceanography
A Study of Intermediate Water Circulation in the Strait of Georgia using tracer-based, Eulerian, and Lagrangian methods

Question. What are the renewal pathways/timescales of Strait of Georgia (SoG) intermediate waters?

Approach. Combined tracer-based budgets, fixed-point (Eulerian) records, and float/drifter (Lagrangian) analyses to resolve IW circulation. 

Key results (high level). The work delineates IW pathways consistent with estuarine exchange and documents seasonal renewal/ventilation patterns (details developed across the paper and synthesis with prior SoG literature). 

Why it matters. Provides a process-based IW framework essential for biogeochemical (O₂/nutrient) budgets in the Salish Sea.

Kuang et al., 2022 — Continental Shelf Research
Factors controlling dissolved cadmium in the Salish Sea

Question. What sets dissolved Cd distributions and variability in the SoG/Haro/JdF system?

Approach. Observations + a mixing-box model to test conservative endmember control and non-conservative processes. 

Key results. Cd is largely governed by conservative mixing between upwelled Pacific water and Fraser River freshwater, with a biological overprint transferring Cd downward; municipal effluent inputs are negligible compared to natural sources. Winter deep-layer Cd decreases during stagnation, attributed to diffusive removal via CdS precipitation in suboxic porewaters. 

Why it matters. Establishes baseline controls for a toxic trace metal in an urbanized estuary and a method to infer benthic exchange at basin scale.

Stevens & Pawlowicz, 2023 — J. Atmos. Oceanic Technol.
Swish Floats: Low-cost, neutrally buoyant floats for coastal observing

Question. Can robust, isopycnal floats be built cheaply for coastal turbulence and boundary currents?

Approach. 3D-printed, open-hardware “Swish” floats; field trials and performance tests.

Key results. Swish floats are inexpensive (~CAD $300), achieve ballasting precision ~61.6 g with small depth-targeting error, and their higher vertical velocities (~0.12 m s⁻¹ vs ~0.02 m s⁻¹ for Argo) and toughness suit energetic coastal settings. 
 

Why it matters. Lowers barriers to dense Lagrangian sampling of shelves/estuaries.

Sun et al., 2023 — Science of the Total Environment
PBDEs in the Salish Sea: distribution, sources, and dispersion

Question. How do PBDEs partition and spread in the Salish Sea?

Approach. Multi-site sampling across Juan de Fuca–SoG; phase partitioning and transport context.

Key results. Sites near Vancouver Harbour (e.g., G1, J2) show elevated dissolved PBDEs; >95% of PBDEs are typically in the dissolved phase; sediment resuspension emerges as a major source, with boundary-current/estuarine circulation exporting contaminants along-shelf and into the basin. 
 
 

Why it matters. Clarifies dominant sources and transport pathways informing monitoring/mitigation.

Stevens et al., 2024 — Communications Earth & Environment
Deep inflow transport and dispersion in the Gulf of St. Lawrence revealed by a tracer release experiment (TReX)

Question. How fast and how turbulently does the deep inflow transit the Laurentian Channel into the Gulf/Estuary?

Approach. Conservative tracer injection at 279 ± 3 m, plus RAFOS-class floats to track advection/mixing; synthesis with hydrography. 

Key results. Floats indicate along-channel speeds ~2.1 ± 0.3 cm s⁻¹; tracer/floats show shelf-enhanced mixing and cross-shelf export, with uplift that brings tracer toward the surface, implying strong boundary-mediated dispersal. 
 

Why it matters. Provides directly observed advection–diffusion scales for a major North American estuary, crucial for hypoxia, contaminant, and nutrient transport modeling.

Beutel & Stevens, 2024 — Science Activities
Discovering DIY Oceanography: building floats to track deep ocean currents

What it is. A ~20-minute classroom activity guiding students to build simple floats and infer deep currents via deployment/observation. 

Learning goals. Students describe ocean circulation, differentiate surface vs. deep currents, and evaluate how observations support inferences. 

Why it matters. Brings physical oceanography into hands-on STEM education with minimal cost/logistics.

Stevens, 2025 — Global Biogeochemical Cycles
Dissolved Oxygen Variability on the Canadian Pacific Shelf: Trends, Drivers, and Implications

Question. How have shelf O₂ levels changed, and what processes control variability from the shelf break to the coast?

Approach. Synthesis of long-term observations across the Canadian Pacific shelf with focus on QCS and adjacent regions.

Key results. After partial recovery following the 2014–2016 MHW, shelf O₂ hit modern minima in 2022–2023. The decadal trend is −5 to −10 μmol kg⁻¹ decade⁻¹, strongest toward the coast. Projections indicate >50% of the QCS seafloor seasonally hypoxic by ~2050 if trends persist. 

Why it matters. Quantifies an accelerating approach to ecologically significant hypoxia thresholds across a working shelf.

(Preprint) Stevens et al., 2025 — EGUsphere discussion
Coupled O₂ and carbon in the Gulf & Lower St. Lawrence Estuary; feasibility of artificial oxygenation

Question. What rates of O₂ loss and DIC accumulation occur in subsurface waters, and could artificial oxygenation help?

Approach. Long-term observations and budgets to estimate Apparent O₂ Utilization (OUR) and DIC increase, plus a scenario analysis for oxygenation.

Key results. Estimated OUR ≈ 21.1 μmol kg⁻¹ yr⁻¹ and DIC accumulation ≈ 18.3 μmol kg⁻¹ yr⁻¹. A stylized oxygenation scheme would require ≈ 8.3 × 10⁵ tonnes O₂ yr⁻¹ and ≈ 10 years to approach steady state, targeting +55 μmol kg⁻¹ O₂. 

Why it matters. Puts concrete magnitudes on coupled O₂–carbon changes and provides first-order costs/benefits for intervention debates.

If you’d like, I can turn these into a one-page table (per paper: objective, method, key numbers, implications) for a CV/website, or expand any one into a press-ready blurb.

I am writing a blurb for myself for my personal research website. I want you to finish it. Keep the tone accessible (I don't want it to sound written by a LLM) and not too braggadocios.

"My name is Sam Stevens and I am an oceanographer currently based in British Columbia, Canada. I am interested in understanding how and why the ocean changes and the effect of those changes on humans and regional ecosystems. I am primarily an observational oceanographer (I've spent almost a year of my life at sea!) and where possible, I like to design and build my own inexpensive instruments to help me take measurements. My research has spanned a broad range of topics over open ocean, coastal, and nearshore environments, though some consistent themes include... (a mixture of broad and specific threads that tie my research together).

Additionally, my professional experience includes roles as a Metocean Scientist and Scientific Writer, providing services to the subsea cable and offshore wind industry, and municipal coastal restoration and wastewater management operations."

My name is Sam Stevens and I am an oceanographer currently based in British Columbia, Canada. I study how and why the ocean changes, and what those changes mean for people and regional ecosystems. I work mostly with observations (I’ve spent almost a year at sea), and I like to design and build inexpensive instruments when that helps us measure what matters. My research follows a few threads: how currents move heat, oxygen, and carbon along shelves and into estuaries; how mixing—by winds, tides, and internal waves—sets pathways and timescales for transport; and how low-oxygen conditions develop on the Northeast Pacific shelf and in connected inlets. I often pair simple, rugged tools (including DIY floats) with long-term records, gliders, and tracers to quantify circulation and ventilation from the open ocean to the coast.

Additionally, my professional experience includes roles as a metocean scientist and scientific writer, supporting subsea cable routing, offshore wind site assessment, and municipal coastal restoration and wastewater operations. I like work that turns observations into clear guidance for design and policy, and I enjoy sharing practical, open methods with students and partners.

how do I get newline in html
ChatGPT said:
In HTML you’ve got a couple of options for newlines, depending on the situation:

Line break inside text (inline break)
Use the <br> tag:

This is line one.<br>
This is line two.
Paragraph separation (block-level break)
Wrap text in <p> tags:

<p>This is the first paragraph.</p>
<p>This is the second paragraph.</p>
Preserve whitespace and newlines exactly
Wrap in <pre> tags:

<pre>
Line one
Line two
Line three
</pre>
👉 Usually <br> is best for a simple newline, while <p> is better if you want spacing between blocks of text.

Do you want the newline for your personal research website blurb (so it looks like separate paragraphs), or just within inline text?

You said:
OK great- I'm thinking of reorganizing my research content. Currently it's grouped under these  pages: 

  Projects:
    - Swish Floats: "swish"
    - Salish Sea: "salish"
    - Tracer: "trex"
    - Mode Water: "stmw"
    - Gliders: "CPROOF"

I would like to reclassify under more general themes. Perhaps "Atlantic", Pacific, and instrumentation, or something like that. Any other ideas? 
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 19s
Great idea to regroup—“Atlantic, Pacific, and instrumentation” mixes regions with a method bucket. Here are three clean schemes; pick one as the primary nav and use tags for everything else.

Option 1 — Process-first (recommended)
Top-level = scientific themes; use tags for region, scale, and methods.

Circulation & Ventilation — STMW, TReX advection/dispersion, TEF/inflow.

Mixing & Internal Waves — SoG internal waves, boundary mixing, dispersion.

Oxygen & Biogeochemistry — Canadian Pacific O₂ trends, St. Lawrence O₂–C coupling, trace metals/PBDEs.

Observing Systems & DIY Instruments — Swish floats, gliders, methods.

Education & Outreach — DIY oceanography activity, talks.

Why: scales well, avoids odd “instrumentation vs. region” asymmetry, and lets a single project appear on multiple pages via tags.

Map your current pages

Swish Floats (“swish”) → Observing Systems & DIY Instruments

Salish Sea (“salish”) → Oxygen & Biogeochemistry and Mixing & Internal Waves

Tracer (“trex”) → Circulation & Ventilation

Mode Water (“stmw”) → Circulation & Ventilation

Gliders (“CPROOF”) → Observing Systems & DIY Instruments (+ Oxygen & Biogeochemistry when relevant)

Suggested tags (multi-select filters)

Region: Northeast Pacific, Salish Sea, Queen Charlotte Sound, Gulf of St. Lawrence, North Atlantic

Scale: basin, shelf, estuary, nearshore

Method: tracer, floats, glider, time series, Lagrangian, DIY instrument

Phenomena: hypoxia, internal waves, ventilation, mode water, contaminants

URL sketch

/research/circulation-ventilation/
/research/mixing-internal-waves/
/research/oxygen-biogeochem/
/research/observing-systems/
/research/education/
Option 2 — Region-first
Top-level = Northeast Pacific, Northwest Atlantic & St. Lawrence, Open North Atlantic, plus Observing Systems.

Use process/method tags to cross-link (e.g., a “Mixing” tag shows SoG IW + boundary mixing from TReX).

Works if your audience navigates by geography.

Option 3 — Audience / Use-case
Top-level = Research Articles, Field Notes & Data, Tools & Code, Industry Work.

Inside each, filter by region/process. Good if you want to highlight software and metocean deliverables.

Practical next steps (quick wins)
Create 4–5 theme hub pages (per Option 1). Each hub gets:

2–3 sentence overview

Featured projects (cards)

“Selected figures” and “Key papers”

Links to code/data where applicable

Keep project pages but add tags so they appear on multiple hubs.

Set redirects from old slugs (e.g., /projects/stmw → /research/circulation-ventilation/).
If you use Jekyll: add redirect_from in front matter.

Minimal front-matter pattern (SSG-agnostic, Jekyll-friendly)

<p>
Understanding where water goes and how fast it gets there sets the stage for everything else: oxygen supply, carbon storage, nutrient delivery, and contaminant fate. I use tracers, floats, gliders, and long-term records to quantify advection and ventilation from the open North Atlantic to coastal estuaries.

## Featured projects

### Subtropical Mode Water (North Atlantic)
- Observed a dramatic decline in STMW formation and inventory during the 2010s.
- Why it matters: weaker mode water reduces upper-ocean heat and carbon storage, and alters mid-latitude ventilation.

<p>
Mixing links dynamics to consequences. It sets how quickly properties are transferred across isopycnals and how rapidly tracers spread horizontally. I combine Lagrangian observations (low-cost floats), glider sections, and tracer budgets to estimate diffusivities and identify places where boundary processes and internal waves matter most.

Perfect—here’s a clean, low-friction workflow to integrate the new process-first themes, plus concrete front-matter patches for your five existing pages. I’m assuming Jekyll (your files have layout: page + Liquid-style front matter). If you’re on Hugo/Quarto, say so and I’ll translate.

1) Add the 4 theme hubs
Save the four hub files I gave earlier into pages/research/ (or wherever you keep pages), e.g.

pages/research/circulation-ventilation.md
pages/research/mixing-dispersion.md
pages/research/oxygen-biogeochem.md
pages/research/observing-systems.md
Add each to your site nav.

2) Normalize project metadata (front matter)
Add a primary category (for the theme hub auto-list) and rich tags (for filtering/cross-links). Keep your existing permalink, titles, and assets.

CPROOF.md → Observing Systems & DIY Instruments
Replace the front matter block with this:

3) Auto-list projects on each theme hub
Drop this include at _includes/list-projects.html:

{% assign items = site.pages | where: "category", include.category | sort: "title" %}
<div class="project-grid">
  {% for p in items %}
  <article class="card">
    <h3><a href="{{ p.url | relative_url }}">{{ p.title }}</a></h3>
    {% if p.subtitle %}<p><em>{{ p.subtitle }}</em></p>{% endif %}
    {% if p.description %}<p>{{ p.description }}</p>{% endif %}
    {% if p.tags %}<p><small>Tags: {{ p.tags | join: ", " }}</small></p>{% endif %}
  </article>
  {% endfor %}
</div>

<style>
.project-grid { display:grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(260px, 1fr)); gap:1rem; }
.card { border:1px solid #ddd; padding:0.9rem; border-radius:10px; background:#fff; }
.card h3 { margin-top:0; }
</style>
Then, at the bottom of each hub page, add:

{% include list-projects.html category="Circulation & Ventilation" %}
(and similarly for the other hubs: "Mixing & Dispersion", "Oxygen & Biogeochemistry", "Observing Systems & DIY Instruments").

4) (Optional but recommended) Move Google Analytics into the layout
You currently embed the GA snippet on each page (lines ~9–17 across multiple pages). Move it into _includes/ga.html and include it once in your base layout (_layouts/default.html). Then delete the inline copies from each page. 
 
 
 
 

Example _includes/ga.html:

<!-- Google tag (gtag.js) -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XFFDFDXETF"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-XFFDFDXETF');
</script>
And in _layouts/default.html just before </head>:

{% include ga.html %}
5) Redirects (if you change any URLs)
You’re keeping existing permalinks, so nothing breaks. If you ever consolidate or rename slugs, add:

Gemfile: gem "jekyll-redirect-from"

_config.yml:

plugins:
  - jekyll-redirect-from
Each moved page: redirect_from: ["/old/slug/"]

6) Add a simple tag filter (optional UI nicety)
Create _includes/tag-filter.html:

<div id="tag-filter">
  <input type="search" id="tagSearch" placeholder="Filter by tag…">
</div>
<script>
  const search = document.getElementById('tagSearch');
  search?.addEventListener('input', e => {
    const q = e.target.value.toLowerCase();
    document.querySelectorAll('.project-grid .card').forEach(card => {
      const tags = (card.textContent || '').toLowerCase();
      card.style.display = tags.includes(q) ? '' : 'none';
    });
  });
</script>
Include it above the project list on each hub:

{% include tag-filter.html %}
{% include list-projects.html category="Mixing & Dispersion" %}
7) Commit & preview workflow
git checkout -b theme-hubs
# 1) Add the four hub pages under pages/research/
# 2) Patch front matter in CPROOF.md, swish.md, salish.md, trex.md, stmw.md
# 3) Add _includes/list-projects.html (and tag-filter.html if desired)
# 4) Move GA to _includes/ga.html and include from layout
git add .
git commit -m "Add process-first research hubs; normalize project meta; centralize GA"
bundle exec jekyll serve   # or `jekyll serve` depending on your setup
Open:

/research/circulation-ventilation → should list TReX + STMW

/research/mixing-dispersion → should list Swish (+ others as you tag more)

/research/oxygen-biogeochem → should list Salish

/research/observing-systems → should list Swish + CPROOF

8) Sanity checks (1 minute)
Images render? Your pages already reference these assets; confirm they display:

sam_glider2.jpg, glider_deploy.gif (CPROOF) 

hull_finalPAPER.jpg, GoSLv2.jpg (Swish) 

seas_CD_comb_RS_R2.jpg, SoG_v2_page-0001.jpg (Salish) 
 

tracerSpread.png, trexteam.jpg (TReX) 

ncc.png, stmw.jpg (STMW) 

Links/DOIs: Spot-check your JTECH, NCC, and CEE DOIs on the live preview. (All already present on the pages you uploaded.)

If you want, I can also give you a single include to render “cards with hero image” by grabbing the first <img> on each project page—nice for the hubs.

## What we learned from recent oxygen work (QCS)

<p>
In 2022 and 2023, low-oxygen water (hypoxia) showed up across much more of Queen Charlotte Sound (QCS) than we’ve seen before. Gliders, moorings, and ship casts lined up on the same story: shelf-wide bottom hypoxia through summer, with pockets of “extreme” lows for weeks at a time near the coast. Hypoxia used to be rare here; now it’s common in late summer.
</p>

- **How unusual?** Before 2022, only about **2–3%** of historical bottom measurements were hypoxic; in **2022–2023 it was ~13%**, and hypoxia extended farther offshore (into Sea Otter Trough) than on record. Mean bottom O₂ also dropped compared with 2003–2021.  
- **When and where?** Hypoxia appeared first at the shelf break in late spring/early summer and spread onshore, persisting inshore into fall even as the densest water retreated.  
- **A standout event.** At the inner-shelf mooring (Hak1), bottom O₂ fell to the **high-20s μmol kg⁻¹** for ~two weeks in late July 2023—well below typical year-to-year swings.  

<p>
Taken together, these observations point to QCS shifting toward a summer regime where bottom hypoxia is expected most years, with occasional sharper dips. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
</p>

## What’s driving it?

- **Long-term decline at fixed density.** On isopycnals that make up the QCS deep layer (≈26.0–26.75 σ<sub>θ</sub>), O₂ is trending down by roughly **5–11 μmol kg⁻¹ per decade**. Warming explains little of that; instead, **AOU increases** dominate—i.e., poorer ventilation of the source waters that feed the shelf.  
- **Remote link with a lag.** Variations in subarctic ventilation appear in QCS about **eight years** later, consistent with waters advecting along the North Pacific Current into the region. That sets the low-frequency backdrop.  
- **Local timing matters more than raw “strength.”** Upwelling in 2022–2023 wasn’t record-strong, but **when** it ramped up (and winter upwelling pulses) helped set productivity and utilization, pushing O₂ lower in summer.  
- **On-shelf consumption is non-trivial.** Glider transects show an across-shelf AOU increase of ~**30 μmol kg⁻¹** from the break to the inner shelf. With typical transit times through Sea Otter Trough, that implies **OUR ~0.5–0.8 μmol kg⁻¹ day⁻¹**, in line with nearby fjords and models. This local drawdown helps explain why inshore waters can stay hypoxic even after the densest water pulls back.

## Where this is headed

- **More frequent bottom hypoxia** is likely in coming decades as the background O₂ keeps sliding.  
- By **~2050**, a **large fraction of the deep layer** in QCS is projected to be **consistently hypoxic in summer**, with obvious implications for seafloor habitats and inlet systems that exchange with the shelf.

## What C-PROOF contributed

- **51 glider missions and ~31k profiles (2019–2023)** gave dense sections across Sea Otter Trough and the wider shelf, resolving where low-O₂ water sits by season and how it spreads.  
- **Seafloor moorings (Scott2 at the break; Hak1 inshore)** filled in day-to-day changes and captured the 2023 extreme event.  
- Cross-checks with Winklers and ship CTDs kept the O₂ records tied down to within a few μmol kg⁻¹.

<p>
Bottom line: the glider–mooring–ship blend let us see the pattern cleanly—decadal deoxygenation from offshore, modulated by local timing and on-shelf consumption, now crossing thresholds on the central coast in summer. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
