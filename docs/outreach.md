<h2>Science World- Future Science Leaders Program</h2>

<p> Science World, located just outside of downtown Vancouver in beautiful False Creek, is a not-for-profit science center and one of Vancouver's most instantly recognisable structures. One of Science World's many popular programs is <a href="https://www.scienceworld.ca/futurescienceleaders/">Future Science Leaders (FSL)</a>, an after-school science initiative for teens designed to foster creativity and engage students in STEAM subjects through sessions led by scientists and experts.</p>

<p> With <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/beutel/home?authuser=0">Becca</a>, a fellow oceanographer, we engaged the FSL students with an interesting oceanographic problem: how can oceanogaphers measure currents below the surface of the ocean? With the recently developed <a href="../swish">"Swish floats"</a> in mind, we asked the students to design their own neutrally buoyant floats in the classroom using benchtop supplies and posed a budgeting challenge by pricing each of the components differently. We then tested their floats by placing them in tall transparent tube filled half with water and half with oil, challenging the young oceanographers to get their floats neutrally buoyant at the fluid interface. </p>

<h2>Ocean Diaries</h2>

<p> "Ocean Diaries" was a virtual education program coordinated by the Bermuda Aquarium, Museum, and Zoological Society (BAMZ) and the Bermuda Underwater Exploration Institute (BUEI). A popular undertaking with tens of thousands of online views, the series aimed to link "ocean explorers" from around the world to "ocean enthusiasts" in Bermuda and beyond. I had the privilege of contributing to this engaging program with noted solo racing yachtsman and award-winning author Neal Peterson and two entusiastic young Bermudian sailors to shed light on the significant influence of the Gulf Stream on sailing races and navigation. Using interactive maps, I explained the formation of eddies and how they impact tactical decisions during sailboat races. </p>

<p> Vancouver-based radio show Rhythmanalysis combines music with scientific discussion— in this episode we talked about everything from our research in the Salish Sea to pancake recipes and played some music that makes us think of the ocean.</p>
