<h2>Ocean Diaries</h2>

<p> "Ocean Diaries" was a virtual education program coordinated by the Bermuda Aquarium, Museum, and Zoological Society (BAMZ) and the Bermuda Underwater Exploration Institute (BUEI). A popular undertaking with tens of thousands of online views, the series aimed to link "ocean explorers" from around the world to "ocean enthusiasts" in Bermuda and beyond. I had the privilege of contributing to this engaging program with noted solo racing yachtsman and award-winning author Neal Peterson and two entusiastic young Bermudian sailors to shed light on the significant influence of the Gulf Stream on sailing races and navigation. Using interactive maps, I explained the formation of eddies and how they impact tactical decisions during sailboat races. </p>

<p> Vancouver-based radio show Rhythmanalysis combines music with scientific discussionâ€” in this episode we talked about everything from our research in the Salish Sea to pancake recipes and played some music that makes us think of the ocean.</p>
