<h2>Ocean Diaries</h2>

<p> "Ocean Diaries" was a virtual education program coordinated the Bermuda Aquarium, Museum, and Zoological Society (BAMZ). A popular undertaking with 10s of thousands of online views, the series aimed to link "ocean explorers" from around the world to ocean enthusiasts in Bermuda and beyond. I had the privilege of contributing to this engaging program with noted solo racing yachtsman and award-winning author Neal Peterson and two entusiastic young Bermudian sailors to shed light on the significant influence of the Gulf Stream on sailing races and navigation. Using interactive maps, I explained the formation of eddies and how they impact tactical decisions during sailboat races. </p>

<p> Vancouver-based radio show Rhythmanalysis combines music with scientific discussion— in this episode we talked about everything from our research in the Salish Sea to pancake recipes and play some music that makes us think of the ocean.</p>
