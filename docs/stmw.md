description: Explore the research conducted by Sam Stevens on the variability of North Atlantic Subtropical Mode Water at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS). The page details the observed decline in this water mass, correlating it with increased surface temperatures and its broader implications.

<p>
    While working at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series study (BATS) and Hydrostation-S projects at the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences, my research was directed on changes in the water mass structure in the BATS region, with a specific focus on Subtropical Mode Water. This water mass, dubbed ''eighteen degree water`` due to its characteristic temperature, is a significant sink for carbon dioxide and acts as an important nutrient source for organisms in the surface waters. In the 2010's, we documented a dramatic loss of STMW linked to increased surface warming in the North Atlantic.
