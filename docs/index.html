<h2>About me</h2>

<p align="justify">
    My name is Sam Stevens and I am a sea-going oceanographer currently based in British Columbia, Canada. I am interested in understanding how and why the ocean changes and the effect of those changes on humans and regional ecosystems. I am primarily an observational oceanographer (I've spent almost a year of my life at sea!) and where possible, I like to design and build my own inexpensive instruments to help me take measurements. I also use theory and model outputs to help me understand the ocean. 
    
    Currently, I am a part of the Canadian-Pacific Robotic Ocean Observing Facility (C-PROOF) research team where I mostly use ocean gliders and other autonomous platforms to understand the physical processes that influence ecosystems along the northeast Pacific continental shelf. Additionally, my professional experience includes roles as a Metocean Scientist and an oceanographic consultant, providing services to the offshore wind industry and government coastal restoration and wastewater management operations.

<h3>Contaminant Dispersal in the Strait of Georgia and Salish Sea: 2017 to date</h3>

This project aims to investigate the impact of various factors in the water column of the Strait of Georgia (such as circulation, mixing, biological productivity, and turbidity) on the dispersal and elimination of harmful pollutants. My specific role in this project is to measure and analyze crucial aspects of the deeper water circulation, specifically focusing on how it varies in both space and time within the intermediate waters of the Strait of Georgia. By doing so, my goal is to provide a foundation for understanding the biogeochemical measurements made during the project by providing transit time distributions and simple circulation models.

<h3>TReX Deep- a tracer release experiment in the Gulf of St. Lawrence: 2020 to date</h3>

The TReX Deep project is a collaborative multidisciplinary project centred around the release and subsequent tracking of an inert chemical tracer in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. As a region that is proving particulary vulnerable to various aspects of climate change, the goals of this study are to better understand the transport pathways and transit time distributions of inflow waters from Cabot Strait into the St. Lawrence estuary and wider Gulf. My role in this project is to compile various data streams, most importantly the measurements of tracer spreading since the injection, to quantify the horizontal and vertical dispersion of inflow waters.

<p>
While working at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series study (BATS) and Hydrostation-S projects at the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences, my research focused on changes in the water mass structure in the BATS region, with a specific focus on Subtropical Mode Water. This water mass, dubbed ''eighteen degree water`` due to its characteristic temperature, is an important sink for carbon dioxide and acts as an important nutrient source for organisms in the surface waters. In the 2010's, we documented a dramatic loss of STMW linked to increased surface warming in the North Atlantic.
