<p>
   The TReX Deep project is a collaborative multidisciplinary project centred around the release and subsequent tracking of an inert chemical tracer in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. As a region that is proving particulary vulnerable to climate change, the goals of this study are to better understand the transport pathways and transit time distributions of inflow waters from Cabot Strait into the St. Lawrence estuary and wider Gulf. My role in this project is to quantify the horizontal and vertical dispersion of inflow waters using the measurements of tracer spreading since the injection.
