description: Sam Stevens outlines the objectives and findings of the TReX Deep tracer release experiment in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The research addresses the dynamics of deep water transport and its environmental consequences in the context of local changes in circulation and climate change.

   The TReX Deep project is a collaborative multidisciplinary project centred around the release and subsequent tracking of an inert chemical tracer in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. As a region that is proving particulary vulnerable to climate change, the goals of this study are to better understand the transport pathways and transit time distributions of inflow waters from Cabot Strait into the St. Lawrence estuary and wider Gulf. My role in this project is to quantify the horizontal and vertical dispersion of inflow waters using the measurements of tracer spreading since the injection.

  One interesting possible application of studying deepwater dispersion in the region is a novel approach using oxygen— a byproduct of green hydrogen production- to combat the expanding hypoxic zones in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Further details on this approach can be found on <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/hypoxic-gulf-of-st-lawrence-quebec-researchers-oxygen-hydrogen-1.7081325" target="_blank">CBC News</a>.
